# fedora
A set of Fedora (and other RPM-based Linux distros) scripts and utilities

## What we have here?
- UnitedRPMs GPG keys for Fedora & repo
- RPM Fusion Free & Non-Free repos
- Fedora Workstation Non-Free repos
- Development Tools
- Nvidia drivers
- Docker CE
- Microsoft PowerShell

**Notes:**
- Maybe there's a minimal interaction (some Yes/No answers, sudo elevation needs, etc)
- Remember to reboot when you are done ;-)
